# Multi-Agent Construction Management Network

**This system aims to bring automation, trust, and efficiency to construction project management.**
This project is a **multi-agent system** designed to automate and manage construction projects using the Masumi Cardano blockchain. Our goal is to make the process of bidding, scheduling, payments, and progress tracking more efficient, transparent, and secure for all parties involved.

## How It Works

### 1. Project Start

- **Client Agent**: The client (end-user) tells the system what they need and their budget.
- **Master Agent**: The main agent for the Builder Company receives this information and creates a contract with the client.

### 2. Bidding

- **Bidding Agent**: Subcontractors submit their bids for different parts of the construction job.
- **Master Agent**: Chooses the best bid for each task.
- **Payment Agent**: Sets up a contract with the winning subcontractor.

### 3. Scheduling

- **Scheduling Agent**: Schedules when each subcontractor will work, based on the Master Agent’s instructions and project needs.

### 4. Work & Progress Tracking

- **Vision Agent**: Monitors the construction site and tracks progress.
- **Master Agent**: Checks the Vision Agent’s reports and verifies them with the subcontractor’s updates.

### 5. Payments

- **Payment Agent**: Pays subcontractors automatically when milestones (like 80% completion) are verified by the Master Agent.

### 6. Continuous Scheduling

- As each part of the project nears completion, the Scheduling Agent prepares the next subcontractor to start, using updated progress information.

### 7. Transparency

- **Dashboard**: The Master Agent keeps a dashboard that shows live project status.
- **Client Agent**: Clients can view reports and project updates at any time for full transparency.

## Summary

- **Clients** get a simple, transparent way to manage construction projects.
- **Subcontractors** can bid and get paid automatically when work is verified.
- **Builder Companies** can coordinate all parts of a project with less manual effort.
- **All transactions and contracts** are securely managed on the Masumi Cardano blockchain.
